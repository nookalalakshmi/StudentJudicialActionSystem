The hotel City Centaur employs about 250 people of various categories which include receptionists, cooks,
housekeeping staff, Managers Etc. The hotel’s total asset would be around 9 million dollars. City Centaur 
group is mainly in the hospitality sector and they also own 2 resorts and 3 apartments in the outskirts of Bangalore.

My client is my friend’s friend whose site was 4 years old and badly needed a renovation. My friend Pragnan B 
referred me to this person Mallikarjun Nataraj who is the Chairman and Managing director of Hotel City Centaur. 
Initially I mailed him saying that I can create a new website for him for free of cost, for which he was pretty 
excited and enthusiastic. Ultimately he accepted the offer after getting convinced with my skills and abilities. 

I was very much interested in doing a complete website from the scratch for some professional purpose. When I 
heard about this opportunity, I very enthusiastically pursued the client and convinced him regarding my skills 
and abilities in getting the website done for Hotel City Centaur. I felt that this was a great opportunity for me 
to apply the skills I learned in my under graduate web programming course, Advanced data base and Info Architecture 
for web courses during my graduate studies.I showed him the Student Judicial Action web application which we did in 
the fall of 2012 as a partof Advanced Data Base Concepts course.I felt that it would give me a real world experience 
and also felt that I could put this on my resume which helps me meet a potential employer for fetching internship 
and fulltime job later during the course of time.

Mr. Mallikarjun Nataraj who is my client was initially enthusiastic about the offer and he too showed great interest 
and cooperated well with me in getting the requirements. I sent him my Resume in which I had mentioned about my 
experience of web development in my previous organization Schneider Electric. I had also mentioned about my web 
development skills which includes HTML, CSS, PHP, ASP.Net etc. Even though initially it didn’t make any sense to 
him after going through my resume as he was not aware of these technologies and his field of expertise is different. 
I had to have a meeting with him for an hour in which I gave him a brief overview of technologies, the kind of work 
I did and gave a demo of the Student Judicial Action website over Microsoft Net meeting. He was pretty convinced with 
my abilities and looked positive in accepting the offer. He also said that it is a good deal as he was getting a 
website built for free of cost, and since Bangalore being a major software hub of India, he was aware that it would 
cost a lot of money to get the same thing done from a software company.

Finally I am happy that I was successful in convincing the client in whose project I was interested. Now I look 
forward to work closely with him in getting all the necessary requirements for building the website and also learn 
during the course of time.
